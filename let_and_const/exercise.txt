In this exercise, youâ€™ll refactor some ES5 code into ES2015.

ES5 Global Constants
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

ES2015 Global Constants
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 42;

b. What is the difference between var and const?
- var are globally scoped while const are block scoped.
- var can be update/re-declared. const cannot be updated and redeclared.

c. What is the difference between let and const?
- The only difference is when I declared a variable with const, I cannot reassign it to a new value. With let I can reassign.
